Hi! My name is Luke, and I'm a PhD student in Experimental Psychology at Dalhousie University.
I research the personality underpinnings of antisocial behaviour and political behaviour.
Recently, I have investigated how personality traits relate to Canadian political partisanship, political incivility on social media, strategic voting, cyberbullying, and academic cheating.
